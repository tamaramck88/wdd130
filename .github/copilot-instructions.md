# WDD 130 Course Template - AI Assistant Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Web Development course (WDD 130) template repository containing weekly exercises and examples for learning HTML and CSS fundamentals. The project follows a structured weekly progression from basic HTML to advanced CSS layouts.

## Repository Structure
- `index.html`: Main course homepage template
- `styles/`: Global styles directory
- `images/`: Global images directory
- `weekXX/`: Weekly lesson directories containing:
  - HTML exercise files
  - `styles/`: Week-specific CSS files
  - `images/`: Week-specific image assets

## Weekly Progression Pattern
The course materials follow a clear progression:
1. Week 1: Basic HTML and images (`week01/`)
2. Week 2: CSS box model and basic layouts (`week02/`)
3. Week 3: CSS classes, IDs, and float layouts (`week03/`)
4. Week 4: Flexbox and advanced layouts (`week04/`)
5. Week 5: Tables and additional CSS concepts (`week05/`)

## File Naming Conventions
- Exercise files: `concept-name.html`
- Solution files: `concept-name-solution.html`
- CSS files: Match HTML filenames (e.g., `concept-name.css`)
- Supporting files are organized in week-specific `styles/` and `images/` subdirectories

## Common Patterns
- HTML files use UTF-8 encoding and responsive viewport meta tag
- CSS files are organized by weekly topics in their respective directories
- Solution files are provided for reference (files with `-solution` suffix)
- Images are stored in relevant weekly directories for scope-specific assets

## Development Guidelines
- Maintain semantic HTML structure as shown in exercise files
- Follow progressive enhancement pattern from basic HTML to CSS styling
- Keep styles modular and week-specific in appropriate directories
- Preserve exercise/solution parallel structure for new content

## Key Files for Reference
- `week01/first-page.html`: Basic HTML structure template
- `week02/box-model.html`: CSS box model implementation
- `week04/flexbox-layout.html`: Modern layout patterns
- `week04/styles/layout.css`: Common layout styles
