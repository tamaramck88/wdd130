      South Africa is a diverse and vibrant country located at the southern tip of the African continent, known for
      its rich cultural heritage, stunning landscapes, and complex history. It is often called the “Rainbow
      Nation” because of its multicultural population and 11 official languages. South Africa boasts some of the world’s most
      iconic natural landmarks, such as Table Mountain, Kruger National Park, and the Cape of Good Hope.
